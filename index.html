          <div class="fifth_section_header">This was me in 2017, I had left my job and everything had fallen apart, I was broke and frustrated with my life. I felt I should have achieved more. In my last job, I was a Group Marketing Manager at a Fortune 100 company so I had earned a lot of money but boom it was all gone so I needed to flee Nigeria for my sanity.  I was going through mental breakdown and needed $700 to buy a ticket to leave because all I had in my accounts than was $138. So I launched my first Webinar product – Sell like a PRO 1</div>
          <div class="fifth_section_header mt-4">Just like you, I did not think people would pay, like why would people pay me for a class? So I priced it at N3,000 | $9. Guess what? In 48 hours, I made $1250 launching the offer to my 4,500 followers on Instagram and 0 people on my mailing list. I got the ticket then and left the country.</div>
